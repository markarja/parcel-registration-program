# parcel-registration-program
Terminal application written in C++ for storing barcodes scanned with a barcode reader and sizes entered via keyboard to an ASCII file. This program was developed as a course assignment to Turku University of Applied Sciences back in 2001 and later taken into production use at SGS Group (nowadays DHL Supply Chain).
